Visualization and understanding confirmed, death and recoveries cases of covid 19 global data and using Machine Learning model to make prediction for future
Note :  As the dataset was taken from kaggle, the pecisioness of the details and data is doubtfull and inaccurate. I have used the dataset for my exercise, and hence should not be used to conclude on any figures.
